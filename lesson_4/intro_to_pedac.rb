# PEDAC - Problem - Examples - Data structure - Algorithm - Code

# If anything about the problem isn't clear, make sure it is.
# Ask people for clarification.
# Ask yourself questions like "Can I assume all inputs are strings?"
# or "Do I need to return the same string object or an entirely new string?"
# or "Should I consider letter case when deciding whether a word is a palindrome?"
# Things like this. Understand the Problem. PEDAC.

# input: string
# output: different string
# rules:
#     - all palindrome words must be changed to uppercase
#     - "mom" is a palidrome, "Mom" is not a palindrome
#     - output must be a different string object from input
#     - if input is an empty string, output is also empty string

# What is a substring?
# Will inputs always be strings? If not, what should be done for non-string inputs?
# Are single character strings considered non-palindromic?
# Should every character in unicode be possible to make a palindrome out of? For example, is "　死　" A palindrome?
# Should the only thing on the code file be one method and an invocation to that method? Are multiple methods allowed?

# input: string
# output: array
# rules:
#     - every chunk of palindromic text must be chucked into a new array
#     - "mom" is a palidrome, "Mom" is not a palindrome, it is case-sensitive
#     - empty string input gives empty array output
#     - all outputs must be arrays
#     - all unicode characters are acceptable, including spaces
#     - there must be a single method that does the logic work
#     - the array output can include duplicates of the same part of the string, such as ["abcba, bcb"]

# Be detailed with your data structure!
# You should be able to write a plain English solution to the problem.
