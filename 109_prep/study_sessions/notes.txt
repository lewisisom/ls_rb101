On the 109 exam

- all of the questions will be
specific about what they are asking
- basically teach whats happening,
even if its obvious to you, explain it
- rephrase question and answer the question,
make sure to actually provide an asnwer to the actual question,
re-read the question to ensure its answered
- over-preparing is not a bad thing,
dont be over-confident, or else you will receiev a Not yet grade
- 101-109 is the most content of any exam
- an important thing is PRECISISION,
using the right terminology, like truthiness vs true,
or assignemnt and stuff, small precirision stuf liek that
- time management is also a big one,
theres good articles about it,
so basically, Pay attention to the time
during the exam
- practice doing 3-hour exam
simulations to get used to it
-  
I GOT STUCK,
on line 19, the fix method is called
and s is passed into the method, and the
return value is assigned to the local variable t
- 
TEST MYSELF, EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEENE
def t(f)
  f = 'ad'
end
def t(f)
  f = 'ad'
  f[0] = 'a'
end
def t(f)
  f[0] = 'a'
end
###
- You do not have to regurstatge the same thing
  over and over again, in the exam just say "like I said, blah blah"
- dont make a luandry lsit, you dont have to list
everything thats happening, if something is not used,
you dont really need to say it, just dont make sure to miss anything
- .map .each .select, the method is passing in the block, etc
- just say whats important thats happening in each questions
