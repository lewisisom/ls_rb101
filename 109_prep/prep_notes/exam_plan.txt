This is what I will do before taking the RB109
written assessment. Once I have done these, I shall
take the assessment, unless I am not ready.

- Attend atleast 1 additional study session for RB109,
whether that's TA-led or peer-led, and whether
its aimed towards the written or oral assessment.
- Systematically redo every single Small Problem,
including all Further Explorations, and doing every
subset including Advanced and Debugging.
- Watch all 3 assessment prep Ruby videos,
which is located on the study guide assignment,
and take thorough notes on them, pausing every
couple minutes and testing various things in IRB.
- Review all of the following RB101 assignments,
and be thorough and feel confident about the material.

- Retake all RB101 Quizzes, Lesson 1 through Lesson 6 Quiz,
and score 100% on all of them in a row in under 20 minutes
each, and if there is anything that's not 100%, review the
appropiate material and come back and get pure 100%'s.
- Read through / review Srdjan Corcic's Blog Series,
all parts 1 through 4, and stop to test a couple things
here and there and write down the most important points.
- Work through all of Chris Larwood's Practice Problems,
a Google Doc sheet with dozens of problems you'll see
on the written exam, every question answered thoroughly
in under 8 minutes, so set a timer for 8 minutes each.
- Work through every single Codewars Practice Problem,
there is a Google Doc with 66 problems. Set a 20 minute
timer on every question. Use PEDAC, do not go straight
into coding no matter what. Follow every step of the
PEDAC process completely dogmatically.
- Once this list is empty, I shall take the assessment.
For the actual written assessment day:
- Set an overall timer for 2 hours and 40 minutes
before the test begins, and verify that it is correct,
and set another one for 2 hours and 55 minutes, which will
be the time I will submit my exam. I should be finished with
all questions at the 2:40 mark, and finished reviewing my
answers at the 2:55 mark. I will not submit my assessment
any later than 2:55 even if it is incomplete.
- Set question-block timers every 40 minutes. I should
be done with 6 questions every time the 40 minute timer
goes off.
- During the review section, go over the first 3 questions
first no matter what, just to make sure I didn't make a
nervous mistake settling into the exam.
- Bring two mice with me, the wired mouse and wireless mouse,
just to be sure that I don't fail because my mouse dies.
- Refill my water bottle and go to the bathroom the
minute before taking my assessment.
- I will begin my assessment at exactly 9:00 AM on the
day right after I have done everything in my checklist,
this gives me a certain time I will do it, because I'll
always put it off if I don't, it will begin at 9:00 AM.
- I can do it.
